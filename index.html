  <h1>What is a shooting star?</h1>

  <p>
    <strong>A shooting star is not actually a star as it turns out</strong>, it is a small piece of space rock or dust called a meteoroid that enters Earth's atmosphere at high speed. 
    As it travels through the air, friction causes it to heat up and glow brightly, creating a streak of light across the sky known as a meteor. Most shooting stars 
    burn up completely before reaching the ground, but the flash they leave behind is a beautiful reminder of the constant activity happening in our solar system.
